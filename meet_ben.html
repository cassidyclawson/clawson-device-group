                        <p>
                        Over the last thirty years, medicine has been
                        revolutionized by advances in materials,
                        electronics, manufacturing and research.  Much of this
                        progress can be attributed to engineer-managers like
                        Ben Clawson - creative problem solvers that juggle
                        competing requirements, unpredictable new technologies
                        and resource constraints to produce profitable new
                        medical devices.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Following a fifteen-year career directing
                        industrial-scale research projects for the University
                        of California at Berkeley, Ben entered the medical
                        device industry when he joined Humphrey Instrument's
                        engineering group in 1982.  He then moved to Surgical
                        Dynamics, a seed-stage startup, where he managed the
                        creation of a vertically integrated R&D and
                        manufacturing operation and was instrumental in the
                        development of multiple successful spine products.  He
                        repeated this effort for a second startup.
                        </p> 

                        <p>
                        These early successes in the startup environment gave
                        Ben the perspective and skillset necessary to found BC
                        Tech.  From 1995 to 2010, BC Tech provided the medical
                        device industry with affordable outsourced product
                        development and manufacturing services.  BC Tech
                        employed more than 70 designers, engineers and
                        technicians in a 20,000sq.ft. R&D and manufacturing
                        facility.    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        As a hands-on CEO, Ben personally participated in the
                        planning, research, design and manufacture of more than
                        50 medical devices for venture-funded startups and
                        Fortune 500 companies, ranging from simple disposables
                        to the most complicated diagnostic instruments and
                        therapy delivery systems. His involvement in such a
                        wide variety of projects makes Ben Clawson one of the
                        most experienced executives working in the medical
                        device industry today.

                        The VidaCare EZ-IO provides safe and rapid access to a
                        patient's intraosseous system.  To date, the EZ-IO has
                        saved thousands of lives, earned VidaCare tens of
                        millions of dollars and won several prestigious design
                        awards.  VidaCare outsourced development of the EZ-IO
                        to BC Tech, where Ben Clawson guided the project from
                        feasibility through development and into pilot
                        production.

                        approached BC Tech to resolve several outstanding
                        design issues.  Ben led the challenging  research

                        work at Norian is recognized on multiple patents and
                        awards and was vital to bringing the SRS&trade; System to
